# RNA-seq Differential Expression Analysis

This repository contains the analysis code for an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
project using R, Quarto, and DESeq2.

The goal of the project is to perform differential gene expression analysis
based on transcript-level quantification and downstream
statistical and visualization workflows in R.
